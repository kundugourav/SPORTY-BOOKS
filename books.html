          <h4>Summary Of The Book</h4>
          <p>Himalayan Blunder: The Angry Truth About India’s Most Crushing Military Disaster documents the reasons and after-effects of the Sino-Indian War in 1962, which resulted in India’s defeat to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. This book starts off with Dalvi telling the readers about his time at DSSC, Wellington. One day, a guest faculty, who was a retired British official, stopped the class suddenly and told his students that they would need to fight for their country during the India-China war. The retired official gained top secret information about the fact that Nehru signed the Panchsheel agreement with China, giving up the post in Tibet, which was maintained by the British to keep a tab on Chinese advance.
Dalvi was angered greatly by the gentleman’s criticism of his country’s leader, Nehru. Dalvi goes on to explain that the British had top-secret information about China’s imperial ambitions, making them utilize Tibet as a buffer state. The Chinese slowly captured Tibet in 1950, and India didn’t condemn the attack, because of Nehru’s China-friendly policy. The Chinese started building roads to Aksai Chin from Tibet. On 8th September, 1962, the war between India and China broke out, with Nehru being away from India. Dalvi was appointed the Commander of the 7th Infantry Brigade in the North-East Frontier Agency.</p>
          <h4>About J. P. Dalvi</h4>
          <p>J. P. Dalvi was an author and commander.

Dalvi was born on 3rd July, 1920. His father worked with the British administration in Iraq and Dalvi returned to India in 1923. He completed his schooling from St. Mary’s High School, Mumbai. Dalvi then went on to study at St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai, under the Jesuits. Dalvi joined the Indian Army in 1940, when the Second World War broke out. Dalvi served as the Commander of the Indian 7th Brigade, which was destroyed during the 1962 Sino-Indian War. He was apprehended by the PLA on 22nd October, 1962, after which he was repatriated in 1963. Dalvi passed away in 1980, due to Cancer.</p>

          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>With a brand new introduction from the author, this is the complete story of how the bomb was developed. It is told in rich, human, political, and scientific detail, from the turn-of-the-century discovery of the vast energy locked inside the atom to the dropping of the first bombs on Japan. Few great discoveries have evolved so swiftly -- or have been so misunderstood. From the theoretical discussions of nuclear energy to the bright glare of Trinity there was a span of hardly more than twenty-five years. What began as merely an interesting speculative problem in physics grew into the Manhattan Project, and then into the Bomb with frightening rapidity, while scientists known only to their peers -- Szilard, Teller, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Meitner, Fermi, Lawrence, and yon Neumann -- stepped from their ivory towers into the limelight. Richard Rhodes takes us on that journey step by step, minute by minute, and gives us the definitive story of man's most awesome discovery and invention.</p>
